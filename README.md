# Autonomous-vehicle-Trials
Trying to put Autonomous vehicle technologies on my cycle before putting in a bike/car/cycle

#What?
Autonomous - moves on it's own to destination place.




#Why?
A part of community fears that it can take few jobs or neutralize the biase on "How people drives everyday".



#How?
Evolve
Trial and error + existing technologies+ documentation on youtube/medium/discord for sponsorship

Start with autnomous bot built using raspberry pi / arduino
Build a autonomous self balancing monowheel/ all terrain skateboard
Build a autnomous self balancing/charging 

Test your learning on a cycle/bike/car.


Technical Requisites for any autonomous vehicles.

#Stable 
Jerk resistance.
Self adjusting the load

#skill requisiste - python skills - IOT skill - control systems (Gazebo+Matlab possibly)

#Existing market solution
Google cycle
Tesla vehicle


#Scope
New autonomous vehicle  market for intersted parties who wants some independency on Tesla monopoly on Autonomous vehicles.
